<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>I am a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.rug.nl">University of Groningen</a>, the Netherlands, where I teach reinforcement learning, among other AI topics, and supervise student research projects. I am also a PhD Candidate with a research focus on multi-agent reinforcement learning.</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Over the past three years as a lecturer, I have supervised more than 20 bachelor's and master's thesis projects, several of which have been published at international venues such as NLDL 2025, and ECAI 2025 workshops. These projects span topics from multi-agent coordination to applications in cyber security and large language model post-training.</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>My PhD research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning in decentralized partially observable settings (Dec-POMDPs and POSGs). I analyze the mathematical structure of these problems to develop algorithms with improved convergence and performance guarantees. In previous work, I applied deep RL to optimize switching control in vehicle platoon systems, demonstrating reinforcement learning for dynamical systems control.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>During my master's studies in Electrical Engineering, with a focus on control systems at <a href="https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english">UNICAMP</a>, I acquired experience in the mathematical modeling of dynamical systems and the resolution of convex optimization problems. This groundwork has helped me understand RL problems on the algorithmic level and discern their connection to output feedback control type problems, for which there are established mathematical tools for analysis.</p>
</div>

Here's a broad overview of my current research interests:
* Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Multiagent Reinforcement Learning
* Transfer Learning in RL
* RL-based Post-training of LLMs with Analytical/Verifiable Rewards
