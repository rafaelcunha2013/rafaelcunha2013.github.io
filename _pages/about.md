I am a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and a PhD Candidate at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl), the Netherlands, working on reinforcement learning (RL) research. 

Currently, I am working on the development of courses for the AI curriculum, along with supervision of master's and bachelor's students enrolled in thesis projects within the AI department.

I am also researching on themes that use transfer learning tequiniques to improve data efficiency in fully cooperative multiagent RL problems. Previously, I worked on a project where we applied RL to 
reduce the fuel consumption of a one-dimension vehicle platoon. I focused on the algorithm-level investigation and convergence analysis of reinforcement learning problems.

During my master's in electrical engineering with a focus on control systems at [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), I gained experience in working with the mathematical description of dynamical systems and solving convex optimization problems. This
gave me the necessary fundation to understand RL problems on the algorithm level and sees that they share a connection to output feedback control type of problems, where mathematical tools to analyse it are already available. 

Previouly, from 2009 to 2017, I have also worked as a petroleum engineer at [Petrobras](https://petrobras.com.br/en/), Brazil's largest oil company. In this role, I was involved in multidisciplinary projects related to on-shore oil field management and reservoir simulations.
Lastly, I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from the [Technological Institute of Aeronautics](http://www.ita.br/) - ITA, Brazil, in 2008. 

The following are broadly my current research interests. 
* Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
* Transfer Learning
* Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning


<!--
As an engineer with a background in electronic engineering and a Master's degree in electrical engineering, my focus has been on applying reinforcement learning to solve problems in systems and control, 
leveraging the knowledge and skills I gained in areas such as hybrid systems, Markov jump linear systems, and optimization. 

During my PhD, I applied machine learning methods to increase the fuel efficiency of autonomous vehicles and developed a novel algorithm that optimizes data usage in a multi-agent setting.

I have also worked as a petroleum engineer at Petrobras, Brazil's largest oil company. In this role, I was involved in multidisciplinary projects and presented at national in-company conferences,

My PhD research has focused on the algorithm-level investigation and convergence analysis of reinforcement learning problems.

My PhD research has focused on the algorithm-level investigation and convergence analysis of machine learning problems.

Previously, I worked on a project where we applied RL techniques to reduce the fuel consumption of a one-dimension platoon. Currently, I am working on a project that uses transfer learning tools such as general policy evaluation, general policy improvement, and successor features to a fully cooperative multiagent RL scenario.

From 2009 to 2017, he worked as a Petroleum Engineer at Petrobras, Brazil. In 2018, he received his M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Campinas â€“ UNICAMP, Brazil. He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, where he has also been a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence since 2023. His research interest includes reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and control theory.
