Multi-agent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework that allows an agent to behave near-optimally through a trial and error exploration of the environment. Although originally developed for single-agent settings, RL approaches have been extended to scenarios where multiple agents learn concurrently by interacting with each other. To deal with the strategic interaction between those rational decision-makers, game theory models are necessary. These are the basic theories surrounding the DeepMind AlphaStar project, for example.

# Subject of design:

This project aims to analyze whether and how RL and game theory tools are used to solve multi-agent systems problems. We will run numerical simulations to compare the performance of different algorithms.

# Field of knowledge: 

Game theory, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning
